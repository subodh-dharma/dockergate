Coming up with least privilege policies to improve Container Security is a time-consuming and difficult task. DockerGate represents an initial step towards achieving tighter policies by leveraging the capability of static analysis on code. It is able to reduce the attack surface on the host kernel and keep the Docker containers functional at the same time. We believe better results can be produced when complete code coverage can be achieved by including all types of executable code. The same approach could be extended to creating Network-related policies for Docker container.
