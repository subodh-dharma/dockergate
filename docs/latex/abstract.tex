\begin{abstract}
Docker has become a popular technology used by cloud services because of the ease of deployment and process isolation provided to the apps. By default, docker has access to a majority of system calls that are made to the host kernel. This unrestricted access of system calls results in exposing a greater attack surface for sharing same kernel. Docker version 17.03 onwards includes support for a Seccomp profile that can allow or deny system calls that the applications inside a Docker container can make. However, it is impractical to manually define a Seccomp profile for a particular Docker image without innate knowledge of all executable code inside. In this paper we propose DockerGate, a tool that can statically analyze a docker image to identify the system calls in the executable binaries present in the docker image and generate a Seccomp policy. Our key insight here is that static analysis can be reliably used to figure out what system calls are required by each individual container. We evaluate DockerGate by using the tool to generate Seccomp policies for 200 images and running each image within a container with the policy applied. The policy generated should have a minimum number of system calls required for the successful execution of applications in the container, therefore, producing a least privileged Seccomp policy.
